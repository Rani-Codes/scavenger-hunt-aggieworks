# scavenger-hunt-aggieworks


Backend:
- I made a venv for my backend to store the dependencies I installed.
- To run the backend locally please run 'uvicorn backend.main:app --reload' inside of the scavenger-hunt-aggieworks directory
- You can create your own username and password to test the app but I already made a test account if you want to use that instead
    - Credentails are 
        -Username: Admin 
        -Password: Password
- I chose to use env variables to model best practices but for this project they need to be exposed so you can test the code so I have commited the .env file instead of adding it to a gitignore.
